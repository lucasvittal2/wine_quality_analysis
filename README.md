# wine_quality_analysis
This is one of my first data sceince project where I try to analyse wine dataset in order to build a model able to classificate the wine quality
This is a personal data science project that aims to  put all data science concepts that I learned in practice.

This is a soluction based on the following dataset:

a dataset about red and white wines related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
Only red wine quality dataset were used in this project
